### Some Importent Infomation 

There are numerous missing values in the data. Various methods exist to address these gaps, such as researching 'Vin' values to fill missing entries in the 'Make' column. However, for now, I will remove the rows with missing values. The dataset is large enough to allow this, as missing values account for less than 5% in almost all columns, except for the 'Transmission' column, which has 13% missing values.
